               <h2> The History of JavaScript </h2>
            
<p>JavaScript is everywhere, and for the seventh year in a row, it has been ranked the most commonly used programming language, with 67.8% of developers employing it in 2019. 
Its ascent to the world’s most popular programming language is synonymous with the rise of the internet itself.The early to mid-1990s was an important time for the internet. <br>
<br>Key players like Netscape and Microsoft were in the midst of browser wars, with Netscape’s Navigator and Microsoft’s Internet Explorer going head to head.
In September 1995, a Netscape programmer named Brandan Eich developed a new scripting language in just 10 days.It was originally named Mocha, but quickly became known as LiveScript and, later, JavaScript.As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).<br>

<br>However, the language itself does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.

                <h2>Website client-side usage</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 95% of websites using it for this purpose. Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM.
                     All major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on the user's device.</p>

                            Loading new page content without reloading the page. For example, social media websites use Ajax so that users can post new messages without leaving the page.</li>
                            <li> Animation of page elements, such as fading them in and out, resizing, and moving them.</li>

            <h2>Libraries and frameworks</h2>
            <p>The majority of websites use a third-party JavaScript library or web application framework as part of their client-side page scripting.<br>

                <br>jQuery is the most popular library, used by over 70% of websites.<br>
                
                <br>The Angular framework was created by Google for its web services; it is now open source and used by other websites. Likewise, Facebook created the React framework for its website and later released it as open source; other sites, including Twitter, now use it. 
                There are other open source frameworks in use, such as Backbone.js and Vue.js.<br>
                
               <br> In contrast, the term "Vanilla JS" has been coined for websites not using any libraries or frameworks, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.</p>

                <h2>Other usage</h2>

                  <p>The use of JavaScript has expanded beyond its web browser roots.
                       JavaScript engines are now embedded in a variety of other software systems, both for server-side website deployments and non-browser applications.

Initial attempts at promoting server-side JavaScript usage were Netscape Enterprise Server and Microsoft's Internet Information Services,but they were small niches. Server-side usage eventually started to grow in the late-2000s, with the creation of Node.js and other approaches.

Electron, Cordova, and other software frameworks have been used to create many applications with behavior implemented in JavaScript.<br>
<br> Other non-browser applications include Adobe Acrobat support for scripting PDF documents and GNOME Shell extensions written in JavaScript.<br>

JavaScript has recently begun to appear in some embedded systems, usually by leveraging Node.js.</p>
